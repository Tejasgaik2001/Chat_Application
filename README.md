### About React.js

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render the components when the data changes. In this project, React.js is used to build the frontend of the chat application, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface.

### About WebSockets

WebSockets is a communication protocol that enables bidirectional and real-time communication between clients and servers. It is particularly useful for applications that require instant updates or live data. In this project, Socket.io, a WebSocket library for Node.js, is used to facilitate real-time communication between the server and clients, enabling seamless and instantaneous chat functionality.
